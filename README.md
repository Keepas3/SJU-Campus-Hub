# SJU Campus Hub

## Overview
Introducing the SJU Campus Hub, a centralized platform designed to connect all events of St. John's University in one place. Our motto is Building for Better Student Life!
The SJU Campus Hub provides information about activities around campus, future club events, study groups, etc. Students can register for events, and this will show up on their personal calendar.
Our primary inspiration was to help students find activities, clubs, and opportunities on campus. Currently, there's no strong alternative hub app or website to connect all students.
